The dataset contains total sales transactions from Walmart across all states and cities in United State. the period of 2011 to 2014.
The analysis was conducted using the power – Bi on Walmart sales dataset of year 2011 to 2014, The methodology focused on identifying patterns, finding out insights and trends relevant to Walmart’s sales. we use to import the dataset into the power-Bi and then add some extra column in it using the new measure in the power-Bi so it help us to find out more insights from the dataset. the new measure I have added like total profit, total sales, total category of the product, also total customer and a total quantity of the products.
